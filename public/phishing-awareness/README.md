# Phishing Awareness by Satender Kumar

**MITRE ATT&CK ID: T1566 – Phishing**  
Stay alert. Stay aware. Don't take the bait.

## "Congrats! You've won a FREE Pizza for Life!"
Just enter your password, SSN, credit card, pet's name, and... blood type.  
Sounds suspicious? It should.

## What This Project Teaches
This interactive phishing awareness demo simulates realistic email-based social engineering attacks. It breaks down how phishing works, what red flags to look for, and how to respond safely — all while aligning with MITRE ATT&CK.

Built for security education and phishing simulations
